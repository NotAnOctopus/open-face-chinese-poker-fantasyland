# open-face-chinese-poker-fantasyland
calculates the best possible fantasyland in ofc or ofc/p, by royalty value (and fantasyland repeat value hopefully but i haven't done that yet)

http://notanoctopus.github.io/open-face-chinese-poker-fantasyland/ is the URL

this is the first website i've ever designed, ever, ever. i haven't even done hello world in github pages yet! i'd really appreciate it if anyone reading this tells me how to improve it or clean up my code or stuff like that. like the non-existent graphics - they definitely need to be touched up.
